# Image Classifier project
# description
Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program In the first part of the project, I worked through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with TensorFlow then converted it to command line application. The project was on the [Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). 
In order to complete this project, I used the GPU enabled workspaces within the classroom, but running on your local CPU will likely take longer time.

**The work in the first part of this project was:**
* Load the image dataset and create a pipeline.
* Build and train an image classifier on this dataset. Then,save the model.



# Part 2 - Building the Command Line Application
After building and training a deep neural network on the flower data set I converted it into Python script application that run from the command line For testing, you should use the saved Keras model in the first part.
The predict.py module should predict the top flower names from an image along with their corresponding probabilities


# Images for Testing
In the Command Line Interface workspace there were 4 images in the ./test_images/ folder to check prediction.py module. The 4 images are:

* cautleya_spicata.jpg
* hard-leaved_pocket_orchid.jpg
* orange_dahlia.jpg
* wild_pansy.jpg
